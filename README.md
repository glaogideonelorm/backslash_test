## Project Overview

This project consists of two main parts:
- **Backend:** Built with Node.js and Express, it handles product management and shopping cart API requests. Data is stored locally in JSON files.
- **Frontend:** A React application built with TypeScript and Vite. It fetches data from the backend using Axios and manages state with Redux Toolkit. The UI is designed to be responsive.

## Features

- **Product Management:**  
  - Retrieve all products and individual product details.
- **Shopping Cart:**  
  - Add, update, and remove items from the cart.
- **State Management:**  
  - Redux Toolkit is used to manage the shopping cart state.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  - The UI adjusts for various screen sizes.
- **API Integration:**  
  - Axios is used for making API calls between the frontend and backend.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-backend.git
   cd ecommerce-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **API Endpoints:**
   - `GET /products` – Retrieves all products.
   - `GET /products/:id` – Retrieves a product by its ID.
   - `GET /cart` – Retrieves the shopping cart.
   - `POST /cart` – Adds an item to the cart.
   - `PUT /cart/:id` – Updates an existing cart item.
   - `DELETE /cart/:id` – Removes an item from the cart.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-frontend.git
   cd ecommerce-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your frontend project.
   - Add the backend API URL:
     ```env
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
     ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

### Backend (Railway)
- **Deploying:**  
  Push your backend code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub) and connect it to [Railway](https://railway.app). Railway will build and deploy your Node.js application.
- **Data:**  
  Data is stored locally in JSON files within the project. Note that Railway's file system is ephemeral; consider using a database for persistent data storage in a production environment.
  Future changes would be made to make data persistent

### Frontend (Netlify)
- **Deploying:**  
  Push your frontend code to a Git repository and connect it to [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Configure the build command (`npm run build`) and set the publish directory (usually `dist`).
- **Environment Variables:**  
  Set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable in the Netlify dashboard to point to your Railway backend URL.

## Approach and Notes

- **Backend Approach:**  
  The backend is simple using node.js and express and storing data in a json file such that it is not persistent, CRUD operations apply 
  
- **Frontend Approach:**  
  The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using Vite since it is not a multipage website and does not need complex routing. Axios handles API calls, while Redux Toolkit manages the shopping cart state. The application is designed with responsive CSS to ensure it looks good on various devices.

- **State Management:**  
  Redux Toolkit simplifies state management, reducing boilerplate code. Custom hooks (`useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector`) help integrate Redux with React components.

- **API Integration:**  
  Axios is used for all HTTP requests. Environment variables are configured to easily switch API endpoints between local and production environments.

## Future Improvements

- **Persistent Data Storage:**  
  Transition from local JSON files to a proper database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for persistent storage.
- **User Authentication:**  
  Implement user authentication to allow personalized shopping carts.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:**  
  Improve the UI with better styling, animations, and possibly component libraries.
- **Testing:**  
  Add unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend components.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Improve error handling and loading states in the frontend.
